= Makefile
:toc:
:icon-set: fi
:numbered:

This Makefile serves two purposes. The first is to automate common admin tasks
(like running tests, checking for vulnerabilities, pushing changes to a remote
repository, and deploying to production), and the second is to provide short
aliases for Go commands that are long or difficult to remember.

The exact contents of the Makefile changes from project to project. It's
generic enough that you should be able to use it as-is for almost all projects.

----

The Makefile is organized into several sections, each with its own set of targets:

=== Helpers

* `help`: Prints a help message for the Makefile, including a list of available
  targets and their descriptions.
* `confirm`: Prompts the user to confirm an action with a "y/N" prompt.
* `no-dirty`: Checks that there there are no untracked files or uncommitted
  changes to the tracked files in the current git repository.

=== Quality Control

* `audit`: Runs quality control checks on the codebase, including using `go mod tidy
  -diff` to check that the `go.mod` and `go.sum` files are up-to-date and
  correctly formatted, verifying the dependencies with `go mod verify`, running
  `test -z "$(shell gofmt -l .)"` to check that all `.go` files are correctly
  formatted, running static analysis with go `vet` and `staticcheck`, checking
  for vulnerabilities using `govulncheck`, and running all tests. Note that it
  uses `go run` to execute the latest versions of the remote `staticcheck` and
  `govulncheck` packages, meaning that you don't need to install these tools
  first.
* `test`: Runs all tests. Note that we enable the race detector and embed build
  info in the test binary.
* `test/cover`: Runs all tests and outputs a coverage report in HTML format.

=== Development

* `tidy`: Updates the dependencies and formats the `go.mod` and go.sum using
  `go mod tidy`, and formats all `.go` files using `go fmt`.
* `build`: Builds the package at `main_package_path` and outputs a binary at
  `/tmp/bin/{binary_name}`.
* `run`: Calls the `build` target and then runs the binary. Note that my main
  reason for not using `go run` here is that `go run` doesn't embed build info
  in the binary.
* `run/live`: Use the `air` tool to run the application with live reloading
  enabled. When changes are made to any files with the specified extensions,
  the application is rebuilt and the binary is re-run.
* *Depending on the project* you might want to add more to this section, such
  as targets for connecting to a development database instance and managing SQL
  migrations.

.Example: Makefile targets for working with sqlite

[source,Makefile]
----
## db/connect: create to the local database
.PHONY: db/connect
db/connect:
    sqlite3 db.sqlite

## db/migrations/new name=$1: create a new migration
.PHONY: db/migrations/new
db/migrations/new:
    go run -tags 'sqlite3' github.com/golang-migrate/migrate/v4/cmd/migrate@latest create -seq -ext=.sql -dir=./resources/migrations ${name}

## db/migrations/up: apply all up migrations
.PHONY: db/migrations/up
db/migrations/up:
    go run -tags 'sqlite3' github.com/golang-migrate/migrate/v4/cmd/migrate@latest -path=./resources/migrations -database="sqlite3://db.sqlite" up

## db/migrations/down: apply all down migrations
.PHONY: db/migrations/down
db/migrations/down: confirm
    go run -tags 'sqlite3' github.com/golang-migrate/migrate/v4/cmd/migrate@latest -path=./resources/migrations -database="sqlite3://db.sqlite" down

## db/migrations/goto version=$1: migrate to a specific version number
.PHONY: db/migrations/goto
db/migrations/goto: confirm
    go run -tags 'sqlite3' github.com/golang-migrate/migrate/v4/cmd/migrate@latest -path=./resources/migrations -database="sqlite3://db.sqlite" goto ${version}

## db/migrations/force version=$1: force database migration version number
.PHONY: db/migrations/force
db/migrations/force: confirm
    go run -tags 'sqlite3' github.com/golang-migrate/migrate/v4/cmd/migrate@latest -path=./resources/migrations -database="sqlite3://db.sqlite" force ${version}

## db/migrations/version: print the current migration version
.PHONY: db/migrations/version
db/migrations/version:
    go run -tags 'sqlite3' github.com/golang-migrate/migrate/v4/cmd/migrate@latest -path=./resources/migrations -database="sqlite3://db.sqlite" version
----
****

=== Operations

* `push`: Push changes to the remote Git repository. This asks for y/N
  confirmation first, and automatically runs the `audit` and `no-dirty` targets
  to make sure that all audit checks are passing and there are no uncommitted
  changes in the repository before the push is executed.
* `production/deploy`: Builds the a binary for linux/amd64 architecture,
  compress it using `upx`, and then run any deployment steps. Note that this
  target asks for y/N confirmation before anything is executed, and also runs
  the `audit` and `no-dirty` checks too.
* *Depending on the project* I often add more to this section too. For example,
  a `staging/deploy` rule for deploying to a staging server,
  `production/connect` for SSHing into a production server, `production/log`
  for viewing production logs, `production/db` for connecting to the production
  database, and `production/upgrade` for updating and upgrading software on a
  production server.

== Usage

Each of these targets can be executed by running `make` followed by the target
name in your terminal. For example:

[source,bash]
----
make tidy
----
....
go mod tidy -v
go fmt ./...
....

If you run `make help` (or the naked `make` command without specifiying a
target) then you'll get a description of the available targets.

[source,bash]
----
make help
----
....
Usage:
  help                print this help message
  tidy                tidy modfiles and format .go files
  audit               run quality control checks
  test                run all tests
  test/cover          run all tests and display coverage
  build               build the application
  run                 run the  application
  run/live            run the application with reloading on file changes
  push                push changes to the remote Git repository
  production/deploy   deploy the application to production
....
