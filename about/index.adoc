Welcome to my blog. I'm Hossein (aka "pj" or "hos") and I'll be posting my own
notes, ideas, programs and other stuffs. I am a Programmer / DevOps Engineer
with passions about open-source software and trees. Personally I enjoy
minimalism and simpleness of things.

Also, I use vim btw ;)

== The journey

I was a Computer guy from my early days back in my 1st and 2nd grade.
But all I did was playing video games. Until my dad came to me and said:

____
Don't just play video games kid, it can do much more than that. try to
learn it.
____

And that was it. It became the goal of my life :)

=== Programming

I have a solid background with writing and patching softwares in some
programming languages (`C`, `Lua`, `Go`, `Bash`, `Python`) by _mostly_ using some
tools that required a little programming knowledge to modify / configure or
extend.

.Let me give you an example:
****
I wanted to learn Python language so I needed to take some notes, I decided to
use LaTeX for that matter and my notes were getting dirty, I was losing some of
them, they're getting out-of-hand, then I've decided to use git for managing
them.
****

I learned `C` by patching / configuring the https://suckless.org[suckless]
tools, `Lua` by configuring https://neovim.io[neovim] and writing plugins for it, `Bash` by using
it daily with "Live inside terminal" approach. of cource I've also read books
and documentations for them eventually. `Python` and `Go` are the ones that I
really sat-down and read books / docs about them from the beginning of the
journey.

=== Workflow

A simple guy likes simplicity.

I use https://st.suckless.org[st] as my terminal emulator.
I have https://vim.org[vim] (or https://neovim.io[neovim] I'm fine with both)
as my text editor in my pocket, https://github.com/tmux/tmux/wiki[tmux] as
multiplexer / session-manager by my side, I have a home in any window manger
(but I perfer it to be inside https://dwm.suckless.org[dwm] over the other).
Also for some bidirectional papers and documents I've let the little evil in,
https://github.com/doomemacs/doomemacs[(doom) emacs].

To be honest, I just need a POSIX-complaint shell, tmux, vim and git.
All of these can be repleaced and I'm fine with their alternatives.

==== Operating System

Currently (as of June 21, 2024) I'm using NixOS as my daily-driver OS.

I enjoy NixOS's approach and its reproducability, just starting to like Nix
language / packages manager. I've wanted to learn a functional programming
language anyway (I still might go for Elixir) so, that's might be it,
who knows ;)

====
*Update 1 September 14, 2024*:
Back to my good old
  https://voidlinux.org[Void Linux] for a while now.

*Update 2 January 26, 2025*:
I moved back to Debian(TM) based distros.
  Currently running Linux Mint(TM) on my work machine and personal laptop.
====

I'm very fine and comfortable with most of other Linux(R) Distributions out there.
I've started using Linux with Ubuntu 18.04, shortly moved to Linux mint 18
and used it about a 6 to 10 months, after that I went for Manjaro xfce,
installed it, used it for about 3 or so months and then, I installed Manjaro i3.

The emphasizing *Manjaro i3* is because it really changed the way I look at a
GUI.
