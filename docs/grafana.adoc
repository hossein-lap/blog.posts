== Grafana stack

Grafana offers many tools, which we've grouped into the following categories:

* The core Grafana stack: *LGTM* and the *Grafana Agent*
* Grafana enterprise plugins
* Incident response tools
* Other Grafana tools

=== The core Grafana stack

The core Grafana stack consists of *Mimir*, *Loki*, *Tempo*, and *Grafana*; the
acronym *LGTM* is often used to refer to this tech stack.

.Mimir
Mimir is a *Time Series Database* (*TSDB*) for the storage of metric data. It
uses low-cost object storage such as S3, GCS, or Azure Blob Storage.
Mimir is a fully Prometheus-compatible solution that addresses the common
scalability problems encountered with storing and searching huge quantities of
metric data.

====
An active time series is a metric with a value and unique labels that has
reported a sample in the last 20 minutes.
====

.Loki
Loki is a set of components that offer a full feature logging stack. Loki uses
lower-cost object storage such as S3 or GCS, and only indexes label metadata.

Log aggregation tools typically use two data structures to store log data. An
index that contains references to the location of the raw data paired with
searchable metadata, and the raw data itself stored in a compressed form.

====
Loki differs from a lot of other log aggregation tools by keeping the index
data relatively small and scaling the search functionality by using horizontal
scaling of the querying component.
====

.Tempo
Tempo is a storage backend for high-scale distributed trace telemetry, with the
aim of sampling 100% of the read path. Like Loki and Mimir, it leverages
lower-cost object storage such as S3, GCS, or Azure Blob Storage.

Tempo also offers the ability to generate metrics from spans as they are
ingested; these metrics can be written to any backend that supports Prometheus
remote write.

.Grafana
Grafana has been a staple for fantastic visualization of data since 2014. It
has targeted the ability to connect to a huge variety of data sources from
TSDBs to relational databases and even other observability tools. Grafana has
over 150 data source plugins available. Grafana has a huge community using it
for many different purposes. This community supports over 6,000 dashboards,
which means there is a starting place for most available technologies with
minimal time to value.

.Grafana Agent
Grafana Agent is a collection of tools for collecting logs, metrics, and
traces. There are many other collection tools that Grafana integrates well
with.

=== Grafana Enterprise plugins

These are part of any paid subscription to Grafana.

The Enterprise data source plugins allow organizations to read data from many
other storage tools they may use, from software development tools such as *GitLab*
and *Azure DevOps* to business intelligence tools such as *Snowflake*,
*Databricks*, and *Looker*. Grafana also offers tools to read data from many
other observability tools, which enables organizations to build comprehensive
operational coverage while offering individual teams a choice of the tools they
use.

=== Grafana incident response and management

Grafana offers three products in the *incident response and management* (*IRM*)
space:

* At the foundation of IRM are *alerting rules*, which can notify via messaging
  apps, email, or Grafana OnCall
* *Grafana OnCall* offers an on-call schedule management system that
  centralizes alert grouping and escalation routing
* *Grafana Incident* offers a chatbot functionality that can set up necessary
  incident spaces, collect timelines for a post-incident review process, and
  even manage the incident directly from a messaging service

=== Other Grafana tools

Grafana Labs continues to be a leader in observability and has acquired several
companies in this space to release new products that complement the tools we've
already discussed. 

.Faro
*Grafana Faro* is a JavaScript agent that can be added to frontend web
applications. The project allows for *real user monitoring* (*RUM*) by
collecting telemetry from a browser.

By adding RUM into an environment where backend applications and infrastructure
are instrumented, observers gain the ability to traverse data from the full
application stack.

.k6
*k6* is a load testing tool that provides both a packaged tool to run in your
own infrastructure and a cloud *Software as a Service* (*SaaS*) offering. Load
testing, especially as part of a CI/CD pipeline, really enables teams to see
how their application will perform under load, and evaluate optimizations and
refactoring. Paired with other detailed analysis tools such as Pyroscope, the
level of visibility and accessibility to non-technical members of the team can
be astounding. 

.Pyroscope
*Pyroscope* is a tool that enable teams to engage in the continuous profiling
of system resource use by applications (CPU, memory, etc.). Pyroscope
advertises that with a minimal overhead of ~2-5% of performance, they can
collect samples as frequently as every 10 seconds. *Phlare* is a Grafana Labs
project started in 2022, and the two projects have now merged.

== Common log formats

Logs support performance and capacity monitoring in infrastructure, bug
detection in software, root cause analysis, user behavior tracking, and more.
Following certain guidelines will help your future self when you need to
analyze logs.

Log formats usually identify if they are structured or unstructured, the data
types used in them, and if any encoding or delimitation is being used.

=== Structured, semi-structured, and unstructured logging

It does not matter what your logs look like and they can come in structured,
semi-structured, or unstructured formats.

when designing and building observability solutions, itâ€™s important to
understand the log formats you are working with. This ensures that you can
ingest, parse, and store the data in a way that it can be used effectively.

[NOTE]
====
If you familiarized yourself with the _personas_, you have an awareness of who
they will be used by and for what purpose.
====

==== Structured logging

*Structured logs* have a predetermined message format that allows them to be
treated as datasets rather than text. The idea of structured logging is to
present data with a defined pattern that can be easily understood by humans and
efficiently processed by machines. The log entries are often delimited with
characters such as a comma, space, or hyphen. Data fields may also be joined
using an equals sign or colon for key-value pairs, such as `name=Diego` or
`city=Berlin`.

.A structured log format
....
{
"timestamp": "2023-04-25T12:15:03.006Z",
"message": "User Diego.Developer has logged in",
"log": {
"level": "info",
"file": "auth.py",
"line": 77
},
"user": {
"name": "diego.developer",
"id": 123
},
"event": {
"success": true
}
}
....

An additional benefit of structured logging is that you can validate the
conformation of the data to a schema with tools such as JSON schema. This opens
up the possibility of making version control changes to the schema, which is
where logs and event bus technology overlap.

==== Semi-structured logging

*Semi-structured* logs aim to bridge the gap between unstructured and structured
and, as a result, can be quite complicated. They are designed to be easy for
humans to read but also have a schema that makes it possible for machines to
process them too. They have complex field and event separators and usually come
with a defined pattern to aid with ingesting and parsing. Parsing is usually
done using regular expressions or other code.

==== Unstructured logging

*Unstructured logging* typically refers to log entries that are presented in a
textual format that can easily be read by humans but is difficult for machines
to process. They are often color-coded with blank spaces to improve
presentation and readability.

Parsing and splitting the data correctly creates a disassociation between
events and their identifying metadata. An unstructured log will require some
custom parsing, requiring intimate knowledge of the data and often creating
additional work for the engineer when ingesting data. This also creates
technical liability; the dependency on the log remaining the same restricts
developers from changing logs or runs the risk of parsing and reporting on
unstructured logs prone to breaking.

To aid the ability of machines to process unstructured logs, encapsulation
prevents entries such as stack traces from splitting at an inappropriate
location.

The following is an example of a multiline log, with a naive encapsulation that
looks for line breaks; this will appear in logging systems as four distinct
events:

....
2023-04-25 12:15:03,006 INFO [SVR042] UserMembershipsIterable Found 4 
children for 4 groups in 3 ms
Begin Transaction update record.
Process started.
Process completed.
....

With encapsulation based on the timestamp at the start of the event, this will
be stored correctly for searching.

=== Sample log formats

Many log formats have been used in computer systems. All of these formats have
a common goal of presenting a standard structure or set of fields for recording
important information about the activity of a computer system.

==== Common Event Format (CEF)

Developed by ArcSight to fulfill the *Security Information and Event Management*
(SIEM) use case, the CEF is a structured text-based log format. Using UTF-8
encoding, the format contains a prefix, a CEF header, and a body containing
additional enrichment data.

|===
| Log Section | Description

| Prefix
| It combines the event timestamp and source hostname

| CEF header
a| It combines the following pieces of metadata:

* Software version
* Vendor name
* Product name
* Product version
* Event name
* Product event class identification code
* Event severity

| Body
| It contains a list of key-value pairs

|===

.Example
....
CEF:0|Security Provider|Security Product|Version|123|User 
Authenticated|3|src=10.51.113.149 suser=diego target=diego msg=User 
authenticated from 1001:db7::5
....

==== NCSA Common Log Format (CLF)

As one of the oldest log formats used by web servers, the NCSA CLF has for a
long time been the most common and well-known log formats. It has a fixed
format text-based structure and therefore cannot be customized at all.

.Here is the NCSA CLF field list:
* Remote host address
* Remote log name
* Username
* Timestamp
* Request and protocol version
* HTTP status code
* Bytes sento

Where data is missing from the log, a hyphen acts as a placeholder. Unsupported
characters are replaced with the + symbol.

.Here is an example NCSA CLF log:
....
127.0.0.1 user-identifier diego [25/Apr/2023:12:15:03 -0000] "GET /
apache_pb.gif HTTP/1.1" 200 2326
....

==== W3C Extended Log File Format

The Microsoft Internet Information Server log format known as W3C is a
structured yet configurable format. Full control over the included fields
ensures log files contain the most relevant data. Identification of the
information or direction of flow is denoted using a string prefix: server (S),
client (C), server to client (SC), and client to server (CS).

.Here is the W3C Extended Log File Format field list:
* Timestamp
* Client IP
* Server IP
* URI-stem
* HTTP status code
* Bytes sent
* Bytes received
* Time taken
* Version

.Here is an example W3C log:
....
#Software: Internet Information Services 10.0
#Version: 1.0
#Date: 2023-04-25 12:15:03
#Fields: time c-ip cs-method cs-uri-stem sc-status cs-version
12:15:03 10.51.113.149 GET /home.htm 200 HTTP/1.0
....

==== Windows Event Log

The Microsoft Windows operating system comes with a built-in complex structured
logging system that captures data related to specific events on the operating
system. There are four common Windows event log categories - system,
application, security, and setup - and an additional special category for
forwarded events.

Each event log is also one of five different types: information, warning,
error, success audit, and failure audit. Windows Event Log is one of the most
verbose log formats in use. It usually includes details such as timestamp,
event ID, username, hostname, message, and category, making it invaluable in
diagnosing problems. Windows event IDs are documented and searchable, so you
can easily get detailed information regarding the log event; they are grouped
into categories, narrowing down the area where the event occurred, which makes
debugging very accurate.

.Here is a trimmed example of Microsoft Windows Event Log:
....
An account was successfully logged on.
Subject:
Security ID: SYSTEM
Account Name: DESKTOP-TMC369$
Account Domain: WORKGROUP
Logon ID: 0xE37
Logon Information:
New Logon:
Security ID: AD\DiegoDeveloper
Account Name: diego.developer@themelt.cafe
Account Domain: AD
Logon ID: 0xEC4093F
Network Information:
Workstation Name: DESKTOP-TMC369
....

==== JavaScript Object Notation (JSON)

As one of the newer yet most commonly used log formats today, JSON is a
structured format constructed from multiple key-value pairs. Using JSON, data
can be nested into different layers while keeping the format easy to read.
Additionally, different data types can be represented, such as string, number,
Boolean, null, object, and array.

.Here is an example JSON log file:
....
{
"timestamp": "2023-04-25T12:15:03.006Z",
"message": "User Diego.Developer has logged in",
"log": {
"level": "info",
"file": "auth.py",
"line": 77
},
"user": {
"name": "diego.developer",
"id": 123
},
"event": {
"success": true
}
}
....

==== Syslog

The go-to log format for many years and still widely used, Syslog is a defined
standard for creating and transmitting logs. The *Syslog transport protocol*
specifies how log transmission takes place, as well as the data format. The
default network ports for the protocol are `514` and `6514`, with the latter
being used for encryption.

The Syslog message format combines a standardized header and message holding
the body of the log.

.Here is an example Syslog log:
....
Apr 25 12:15:03 server1 sshd[41458] : Failed password for  diego from 
10.51.113.149 port 22 ssh2
....

==== Logfmt

Logfmt is a widely used log format that fits as human readable and structured
so that computers and people can both read it. A Logfmt-formatted log line
consists of any number of key-value pairs that can be easily parsed. As there
are no standards, it is easy to extend and perfect for developers to simply add
more key-value pairs to the output.

.Here is an example Logfmt log:
....
level=info method=GET path=/ host=myserver.me fwd="10.51.113.149" 
service=4ms status=200
....

== Exploring metric types and best practices

Metrics, along with logs, are an essential tool for software developers and
operators, providing them with indicators regarding the state of applications
and systems. Resource usage data is great for monitoring a metric that captures
numerical data over time. There are many different types of resources but some
good examples would be CPU or RAM usage, the number of messages in a queue, and
the number of received HTTP requests. Metrics are frequently generated and
easily enriched with labels, attributes, or dimensions, making them efficient
to search and ideal in determining if something is wrong, or different from
usual.

.A metric commonly has the following fields:
* *Name*: This uniquely identifies the metric
* *Data point value(s)*: The data thatâ€™s stored varies by metric type
* *Dimensions*: Additional enrichment labels or attributes that support analysis
